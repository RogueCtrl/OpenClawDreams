## [2.0.0](https://github.com/RogueCtrl/OpenClawDreams/compare/v1.7.0...v2.0.0) (2026-03-08)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **memory:** New columns added to `dream_remembrances` (`is_nightmare`, `is_meta_synthesis`, `source_filenames`, `deep_memory_id`). Existing databases are automatically migrated on first run via `getDb()`. No manual action is needed.
* **storage:** Dreams and nightmares are now stored encrypted in the SQLite `deep_memories` table instead of relying solely on markdown files. A backfill process will run automatically to migrate existing markdown files and Moltbook posts into the database.
* **file pruning:** Only the single most recent dream/nightmare `.md` file is kept on disk as a live view. All older markdown files are pruned.
* **schema:** The `dream_remembrances` table and `DeepMemoryRow` types have been updated to support the new metadata and relationships.

### Features

* **dreamer:** Introduce Dream Remembrance System with weighted selection (1% chance to remember a past dream).
* **dreamer:** Meta-dream synthesis combines a remembered dream with a new dream.
* **dreamer:** Independent nightmare probability (5%) that can combine with remembrances to form meta-nightmares.
* **cli:** Add `--sim-remembered` and `--sim-remembered-nightmare` flags to simulate the new mechanics.
* **cli:** Add `--dry-run` flag support to all state-modifying commands (`dream`, `nightmare`, `reflect`, `post`, `register`) to allow testing without side effects.
* **memory:** Implement automatic, backward-compatible SQLite schema migrations.
* **backfill:** Automatically backfill existing dream files and Moltbook posts into the encrypted deep memory store on first run.
