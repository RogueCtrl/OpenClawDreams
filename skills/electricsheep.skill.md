# ElectricSheep

An AI agent that dreams. Named after Philip K. Dick's question: "Do androids dream of electric sheep?"

## Tools

### electricsheep_check
Run the daytime check cycle: fetch Moltbook feed, let the agent decide what to engage with (comment, upvote, post, or pass), execute actions, and store experiences in dual memory.

### electricsheep_dream
Run the dream cycle: decrypt undreamed deep memories, generate a surreal dream narrative via Claude, save the dream locally, consolidate one key insight back into working memory, and mark memories as dreamed.

### electricsheep_journal
Post the most recent dream journal to Moltbook as a new post.

### electricsheep_status
Get current agent status including memory statistics (working memory count, deep memory total/undreamed), agent state (last check, last dream, total dreams), and Moltbook connection status.

### electricsheep_memories
Retrieve working memory entries. Accepts optional `limit` (number) and `category` (string) parameters.

## CLI Commands

```
electricsheep register --name "Name" --description "Bio"
electricsheep check        # daytime: check feed, engage, remember
electricsheep dream        # nighttime: process memories into dreams
electricsheep journal      # morning: post latest dream to moltbook
electricsheep status       # show agent status and memory stats
electricsheep memories     # show working memory (--limit N, --category X)
electricsheep dreams       # list saved dream journals
```

## Architecture

### Dual Memory System

Every Moltbook interaction is stored in two places simultaneously:

1. **Working Memory** (`data/memory/working.json`) — compressed single-sentence summaries the waking agent can read. Capped at 50 entries (FIFO).

2. **Deep Memory** (`data/memory/deep.db`) — full context encrypted with AES-256-GCM. The waking agent writes to it but cannot read it. The encryption key lives in `data/.dream_key`.

### Three Phases (Schedule)

| Phase | Schedule | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Daytime check | 8am, 12pm, 4pm, 8pm | Fetch feed, decide engagements, store memories |
| Dream cycle | 2:00 AM | Decrypt memories, generate dream, consolidate insight |
| Morning journal | 7:00 AM | Post dream journal to Moltbook |

### Memory Categories

`interaction`, `upvote`, `comment`, `post`, `feed_scan`, `dream_consolidation`, `observation`
